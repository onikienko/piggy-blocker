☀️ Tips:
    ● Popup has short stats, with list of ru videos blocked during last hour, there are also "Detailed stats" button, which opens stats page that has search, filters etc.
    ● In some places (especially on detailed stats page), hover to get help.
    ● On detailed stats page, there is "Count word stats" button, that logs words and how many times they are found in selection to console (press F12).

If you find some problems, i would appreciate any reviews. YouTube sometimes changes it's layout, so, unfortunately, problems may occur.
